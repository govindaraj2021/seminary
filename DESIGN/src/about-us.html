            <p><strong>Good Shepherd Major Seminary</strong> is the third major seminary of the Syro-Malabar Church. It was canonically erected at Kunnoth, Iritty, North Kerala, India, by the Synod of the Church on 1st September 2000 (Synodal Decree no. 2336/2000). The seminary was inaugurated on 16th June 2001. Even though India, particularly Kerala, had been the land of the Syro-Malabar Church, the Muslim invasion of the 18th century and certain actions of the Portuguese missionaries had reduced the area of the church to the southern part of Kerala.</p>

            <p>In the 1940s, however, many Christians migrated from the Christian south of 
              the state to the northern part of Kerala in search of a better life. 
              This was followed by the erection of the Diocese of Tellicherry in 1953 
              for the immigrants of the region; many churches and church-schools were 
              eventually established, and Christian institutions began to play an important 
              role in the social life of the region. The presence of a live and active 
              church immediately led the region to a phenomenal growth in all aspects of 
              its life. Several dioceses were also eventually erected.</p>
            <p>By this time several young people of the region, both men and women, were 
              called by God to lead a consecrated life. It is noteworthy that in the last few 
              decades, in the dioceses in Malabar, the Catholic Church could find more 
              young people looking for consecrated life than any other part of the country 
              or even in any other part of the world. The erection of the new major 
              seminary in this region is in fact an ecclesiastical recognition to the region 
              for the role it has been playing in the life of the universal church.</p>
